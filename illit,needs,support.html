<Title> support I'LLIT <3 </Title>
<Body>
<br>
hi guys, this is my first ever webpage made by me, so please support it even though its probably trash:) <br>

<br>

ok guys, its a very controversial topic, but i think I'LLIT is talented, infact very, ofcourse everyone has opinions, <br>
but they do NOT deserve the hate. ofcourse almost everyone, also i myself, wanted Jiwoo to debut in RU NEXT?  <br>
but sadly she didn't debut and we can't change the lineup either, can we? so its better we support I'LLIT as they are.<br>
and for the ''I'LLIT can't sing live'' controversies, i thik they are wrong. they CAN sing live. lets talk about WHERE <br>
this controversy started. this controversy started at "MCOUNTDOWN", i'm not 100% sure, but i think thats right... <br>
anyways, there Moka got hate for her so-call ''goat voice'', but there are reasons, if you view it properly, you'll notice <br>
how her arm was interlocked with Iroha's arm AND Moka was a bit bent and on the other hand Iroha was jumping up <br>
and down, ontop of all that, Moka was  crying. so lets be logical, if the instrument was bent, crying and jumping up <br>
and down, how can they sing perfectly? <br>

<br>

anyways, moving on to the next topic... everyone knows I'LLIT deserves a better concept which actually fits them, i mean ofcourse <br>
they look pretty good in their current concept, but the songs given are not in their range!! so even if the concept is not <br>
changed, lets hope that in the future they get songs which suit their vocal ranges and tones <br>

<br>
 
the next topic, ''I'LLIT copying NewJeans''. ok, i get it, they might be copying NewJeans, because i've seen their choreos being similar, <br>
but its not like they are producing the songs or choreographing their own dances, am i right? and if they ARE copying NewJeans, <br>
for me its pretty understandable because there are probably like a zillion of songs in the world, so its pretty hard to not copy while <br>
producing, and i'm pretty sure that sometimes the copying happens by accident, i know it sounds stupid, but try thinking that way... <br>

<br>

so guys, that was it for me today, goonna go for now, let me know on my instagram (@kp0p_c0r3) if you need me to write more stuff like this <br>

<br>

bye <3
